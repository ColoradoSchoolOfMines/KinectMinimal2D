KinectMinimal2D
===============
Minimal example project for 2D Kinect games.


Usage
===============
After cloning, open the solution in Visual Studio. The project should run out of the box.
If the project is working correctly, the program should wait a few seconds while it sets up the Kinect, then display the color video feed.


Requirements
===============
- Visual Studio 2012+
- Kinect SDK 1.8 (Kinect v1) or 2.+ (Kinect v2)


Modifying the Project
===============
(TODO)
